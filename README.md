## Installation
To install this application, you download Node on your local repository and clone the repository from GitHub. A file system and inquirer module will also be needed for this application. Jest is used for testing this application. To run the application the user have to execute an npm install to install all necessary dependencies.

## Usage
To use the application, the user is presented with a question to describe the first employee of their engineering team. The user then enters the employee's name, he then selects the employee's role from various options such as: Manager; Engineer, or intern. Next he inserts the employee's ID, inserts the employee's email address, and inserts another element that will make a difference between the various roles. After all the information on the employee has been inserted, the user is later asked if there are more employees they will like to include in the team. If yes, the same questions are asked as above. If it is a no, an HTML file is generated presenting all the information about the employees in cards.
